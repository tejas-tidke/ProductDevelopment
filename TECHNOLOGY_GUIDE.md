# Technology Guide for New Team Members

This guide provides an introduction to the key technologies used in this project for team members who are new to them.

## Java and Spring Boot

### What is Java?
Java is a popular, object-oriented programming language known for its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy. It's widely used for building enterprise applications.

### What is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is a framework that makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It simplifies the setup and development of Spring applications.

### Key Concepts in Our Backend

1. **Controllers** - Handle HTTP requests and responses
   ```java
   @RestController
   @RequestMapping("/api/example")
   public class ExampleController {
       @GetMapping
       public String getExample() {
           return "Hello, World!";
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Services** - Contain business logic
   ```java
   @Service
   public class ExampleService {
       public String processExample() {
           // Business logic here
           return "Processed";
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Repositories** - Handle database operations
   ```java
   @Repository
   public interface ExampleRepository extends JpaRepository<Example, Long> {
   }
   ```

4. **Models** - Represent data entities
   ```java
   @Entity
   public class Example {
       @Id
       @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
       private Long id;
       private String name;
       // Getters and setters
   }
   ```

## React and TypeScript

### What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and manage application state efficiently.

### What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds static typing to JavaScript, which helps catch errors early.

### Key Concepts in Our Frontend

1. **Components** - Reusable UI elements
   ```tsx
   interface Props {
       name: string;
   }
   
   const Hello: React.FC<Props> = ({ name }) => {
       return <div>Hello, {name}!</div>;
   };
   ```

2. **Hooks** - Functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features
   ```tsx
   const Example: React.FC = () => {
       const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
       
       useEffect(() => {
           document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
       }, [count]);
       
       return (
           <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
               Count: {count}
           </button>
       );
   };
   ```

3. **Services** - Functions that handle API calls
   ```tsx
   const apiCall = async (endpoint: string) => {
       const response = await fetch(`/api${endpoint}`);
       return response.json();
   };
   ```

## MySQL

### What is MySQL?
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. It stores data in tables with rows and columns.

### Basic Concepts

1. **Tables** - Collections of related data
2. **Rows** - Individual records in a table
3. **Columns** - Fields that define the data in a table
4. **Primary Key** - Unique identifier for each row
5. **Foreign Key** - Reference to a primary key in another table

### Example Queries

```sql
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');

-- Select data
SELECT * FROM users;

-- Update data
UPDATE users SET name = 'Jane Doe' WHERE id = 1;

-- Delete data
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

## Firebase

### What is Firebase?
Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform that provides authentication, real-time databases, cloud storage, and more.

### Key Features We Use

1. **Authentication** - User login and registration
2. **Cloud Firestore** - Real-time database (though we use MySQL for our main data)

- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)

## Jira

### What is Jira?
Jira is a project management tool used for issue tracking and agile project management.

### Key Concepts

1. **Projects** - Containers for related issues
2. **Issues** - Individual tasks, bugs, or stories
3. **Boards** - Visual representations of work (Kanban, Scrum)
4. **Sprints** - Time-boxed periods for completing work

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
1. Follow the established project structure
2. Use meaningful names for classes, methods, and variables
3. Keep functions small and focused on a single task
4. Add comments to explain complex logic

2. Provide meaningful error messages to users
3. Log errors for debugging purposes

### Testing

2. Check that your changes don't break existing functionality
3. Use browser developer tools to debug frontend issues

### Collaboration

2. Write clear commit messages
3. Review code before merging
4. Communicate with team members about your changes
