# Root Path Redirect Configuration

This document explains how the root path (localhost:5173) has been configured to redirect to the login page.

## Changes Made

1. **App.tsx Route Configuration**
   - Added a redirect from the root path "/" to "/signin"
   - Moved the dashboard route from "/" to "/dashboard"

2. **Navigation Updates**
   - Updated AppHeader.tsx to link the logo to "/dashboard" instead of "/"
   - Updated AppSidebar.tsx to link the logo to "/dashboard" instead of "/"
   - Updated the Dashboard menu item in AppSidebar.tsx to point to "/dashboard"
   - Updated NotFound.tsx to link back to "/signin" instead of "/"

3. **ProtectedRoute Component**
   - Ensured the ProtectedRoute component properly handles unauthenticated users by redirecting them to "/signin"

## How It Works

When a user accesses localhost:5173:
1. The root route "/" redirects to "/signin"
2. The SignIn page is displayed
3. After successful authentication, users are redirected to "/dashboard"
4. All protected routes require authentication and will redirect unauthenticated users to "/signin"

## Testing

To test this configuration:
1. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:5173
3. Verify that you are automatically redirected to http://localhost:5173/signin
4. Try to access http://localhost:5173/dashboard without signing in
5. Verify that you are redirected to http://localhost:5173/signin
6. Sign in with valid credentials
7. Verify that you are redirected to http://localhost:5173/dashboard

## Files Modified

- src/App.tsx
- src/layout/AppHeader.tsx
- src/layout/AppSidebar.tsx
- src/pages/OtherPage/NotFound.tsx
- src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx

The configuration ensures a smooth user experience where unauthenticated users are always directed to the sign-in page when trying to access the application.
